# Distributed E-Commerce System for Real-Time Order and Inventory Management

## Overview

This project is a microservices-based backend system for an e-commerce platform, designed to handle real-time order placement, inventory management, payment processing, and analytics. It ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and observability using modern backend technologies.

---

## Features

- **Order Management**: Processes customer orders and communicates with the inventory service.
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks inventory levels across warehouses and prevents overselling using distributed locking.
- **Payment Processing**: Handles concurrent payment transactions securely and efficiently.
- **User Management**: Provides user authentication and rate-limiting.
- **Analytics Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of system metrics.

## Architecture

### Microservices
1. **Order Management Service**:
   - Manages order placement and status.
   - Communicates with Inventory and Payment services using gRPC.
   - Includes circuit breaker functionality.

2. **Inventory Service**:
   - Updates and monitors inventory levels.
   - Implements distributed locks with ZooKeeper for coordination.
   - Uses database row-level locking for critical updates.

3. **Payment Service**:
   - Processes payments with external APIs.
   - Utilizes multithreading and connection pooling for scalability.

4. **User Service**:
   - Handles user profiles and authentication.
   - Implements Redis for caching and rate-limiting.

5. **Analytics Service**:
   - Provides metrics dashboards using Grafana and Prometheus.
   - Aggregates system performance and usage statistics.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Kubernetes & Docker**: For containerization and orchestration.
- **gRPC**: For efficient microservice communication.
- **MySQL (Master-Slave)**: For database management with replication.
- **ZooKeeper**: For distributed locking and leader election.
- **Redis**: For caching and rate-limiting.

### Observability
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and monitoring.
- **Grafana**: Real-time dashboards.
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for debugging and performance optimization.

### CI/CD
- **Jenkins/GitHub Actions**: For deployment pipelines with automated builds and tests.
